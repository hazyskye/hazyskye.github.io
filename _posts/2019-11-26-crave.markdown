In times of sorrow built around your problems,
you begin to bleed and beg
for a new understanding around you

but for the solution you’re not willing to work at
finding suffering in chaos that you demanded

and now act like a reprieve is what you need
when to see you die would please

Popping pills and smoking dope is what you need
if to be a loser is where you succeed

I can’t say that I didn’t pass out, black out, and act like a moron indeed
but it’s where a junkie feels comfortable can’t you see
