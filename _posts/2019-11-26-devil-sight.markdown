I used to see through the devil’s eyes

Now I see right through him and evil lies

Popped each pill like I was ready to die

Yet came the day, finally I wanted to fly

Like a caged bird with no way out

Couldn’t fathom a new escape route

I felt trapped in blackouts heavy

Still each overdose should have been plenty

This insanity though made me dead and empty

Till open doors gave a renewed chance at life

and some God lifted me out of hell

Kept me alive to feel

Time to do better

Peace and serenity doesn’t come in a bottle

Life at positive pace can be full throttle

So don’t discredit what lifted me from infernal tide, as this is the only thing keeping me free and outside that mind of mine
