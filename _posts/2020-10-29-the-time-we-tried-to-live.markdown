The time we tried to live

Was an audacious act

That the rich did not find so adoring

As to us they'd rather crush under feet

Than be meek and humble to another

To care after humanity,

Sharing dragon's hoarde-

How ghostly that we dare request,

As if necessity, the need to love each other

Before the earth alone heeds her breadth

Through toil

To breathe no more
