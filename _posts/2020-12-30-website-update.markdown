I am posting here today after a long hiatus, to inform you of this website's inevitable future. It shall cease to exist in any official capacity except to live as a coding archive of prior web development work. It's *current* and **ongoing** replacement can be found at ***https://www.avelakafo.com/home*** where I plan to eventually migrate some of the writing from this poetry website to that one. Some of the writings I won't migrate, but can still be seen here. Thank you so much for your time. It has been quite an informative experience to develop this site using **GitHub Pages**, **RubyGems**, and **Jekyll** but am moving onto other projects, ideas, and their execution.
