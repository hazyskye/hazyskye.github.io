I feel the pulse slow me down

Can’t hear the shallow breathing

Never could sense a life better than a high in hell

Times passed me by

and I’m noddin’ off deceivin’ u n me

The cops have got me again

In tha 911 truck cryin out to die

Let the pain slip like blood hangin’ out to dry

Drop another pill down m’ throat
 
before I pop a bitch’s pussy wide open

Steal the cherry, then I shoot up

Gotta keep rollin ‘fore the only guilt I know has to grow up

Ain’t no despair when I do ya

This is the truth u be hatin’

Just a junkie chasin’

Money to buy your soul, lube to prepare u

Just relax on them oxys, get urself off the lean

We gonna fuck hard

Reachin oblivion at death’s door

I ain’t ask to be around no more

They try to tell me Ima die yung

Isn’t the goal a short existence before I fade off

need them xannies to pretend that I am happy

Onto greater things so u can at me


Slippin away with the drugs from the plug

Dont bother to attack me

Know the end is gonna back me

Into a corner

So im ready to let the benz

only a matter of time ‘fore I flatline
