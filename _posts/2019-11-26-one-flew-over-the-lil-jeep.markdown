Just keep seeing you in my mind's eye

Lil Peep, my baby Gustav, why'd you have to die? Why oh why was it you and not I? Life isn't fair but I have to learn to not mind.

All I know is I'm a Crybaby and we're out of line.

Keep seeing the blue face and it makes me wanna die, makes me wanna cry..

Yeah I'm a Crybaby but we can learn to fly.
